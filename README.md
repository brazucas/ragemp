# Sobre o Brazuca's

Brazuca's is a Brazilian gaming server started in 2006, originally a server created for the GTA SA-MP mod. We survived throughout the years there until late 2014, where the player base dropped significantly, server admins/developers became adult and after a few months having no players and a infrastructure cost around $100, we finally decided to completely shutdown the server.

There was a few comebacks from Brazuca's in the following years, but not enough player base to keep it online (server costs increased significantly as Dollar became more valued compared to Brazilian Real). As GTA V were launched few years before, we decided that SA-MP became outdated and that we would wait until GTA V has a decent multiplayer mod, is RageMP our messiah? we'll find it out in this project.

# Why not GTA:Network?
We started a project there, but after a couple months there was an announcement basically saying that GTA:O would be merged with RageMP.

# Expectations
We'll give no hopes, no deadlines, no launch dates and no public announcements until the server is ready to release. Everything related to the server will be published in this github repo only, if you are interested in following the development stage, feel free to watch the repo, but again, DO NOT GIVE HOPES ON THIS. 

# Open-Source?
We'll keep it open-source once it's officially launched. Or maybe even after that.

# MVP Goal
Our initial goal is to create a Minigames server, just because it is easily and less complex to develop. Once we hit that goal we'll start building a RPG server.

# Can I join the test team?
Currently our test team is full.

# Can I join the dev team?
Of course! the project is open-source and anyone can contribute.
